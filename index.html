I enjoyed this exchange because after my comment about Mayor Pete,jhaughton commented and defended Warren. I thought this simulated a real conversation on social media in which someone states their political opinion and a stranger comments and defends the original commentor.<h3> My Score should be: </h3><p> I should get 90 for completing all of the tasks, 5 for upvoting the comments having to do with my candidates, 5 for writing over 200 comments, and 10 for posting 20 plagerized comments.this totals 110/100points.</p>
