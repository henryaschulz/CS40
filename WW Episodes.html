 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li> <span style="color:blue"> "Game On"</span> (Season 4, Episode 6)</li>
		<p> The context of this episode is that President Bartlet is running for re-election against Governor Richie of Florida who is a traditional Republican. The first question was about the role of the federal government. Richie said that the government should leave it up to the states to decide what curriculum should be taught instead of the Department of Education. He also said the government should cut taxes because the American people know how to spend their money better than the federal government. President Bartlet responds with the distinction that the United States is sometimes a 50 state union and other times one country. He says we have national needs and gave the example that Florida didn't fight in World War II. He then says Florida got $12 billion from other states within the federal budget. He then poses a question for the governor: Can we have it back please? This debate scene gets at the heart of the 200 year debate about Federalism and the role of the states and federal government.  </p>
	<li> <span style="color:blue"> Two Cathedrals" </span> (Season 2, Episode 22)</li>
		<p> The context of this episode is that the President's secretary, who he knew from childhood, passed away in a car accident. Also, the President has MS and has to decide if he will run for re-election despite having the disease. the public knows about the MS and his administration is worried about the electoral repercussions for him and Congressional Democrats in the midterms. At the end of the episode, the President holds a press conference and he decides that he will run for re-election. Early in the next season, he wins the election. I recognize that this is quite unlikely to happen in reality. However, it highlights an important point about public trust in leaders, especially when it comes to health. When I watched this video, I couldn't help to think about Joe Biden and how his main political obstacle is the perception that he is aging and losing some cognitive abilities. The episode speaks to the fragility of trust between the public and its elected leaders. </p> 
	<li> <span style="color:blue"> "20 Hours in America" </span> (Season 4, Episode 1&2) </li>
		<p> The context of this epiode is that some of the Bartlett staff gets stuck in Indiana after a re-election campaign event. This is simultaneously one of the most comedic and politically poignant episodes in the show. I love this episode because it gets at two important points: All politics are personal and how the electoral college forces elite politicans to interact with the entire country. In the episode, Josh Lyman and Toby Zieger  are in an Indiana bar. A man is sitting next to Josh and Toby. He starts a conversation about how he just took his daughter to visit Notre Dame but is scared about not being able to pay for it. Toby then exchanges contact information with the man and keep in touch with him. A couple of episodes later, Toby calls him to say that they working on legislation to make higher education more affordable. For the first time, Toby and Josh truly see their power and how policies impact everday people. The episode is also an argument for the electoral college because throughout it, the three staffers discuss President Bartlett with rural farmers and other Americans who did not vote for him. </p>
