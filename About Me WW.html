<h1> Henry Schulz is a Sophomore majoring in Philosophy and Government. He was born and raised in New York City and enjoys the bi-coastal experience of LA and the Big Apple. Henry is passionate about public policy, especially public and affordable housing issues that have plagued New Yorkers for years. He also enjoys sharing his love for the West Wing with other political junkies. When he is not talking politics and watching the West Wing, he is on a constant quest to find the best pork bun. </h1>
